# line-testing
Linked Lists and Comparing Queuing Systems: The List.c has functions to use single linked lists. The test_que.c uses those functions to compare two different types of ques. It compares the que where you pick a line and stand there until your cashier is open (these lines are typically shorter) and it compares the que where you stand in one line and go to the next available cashier. To run the program the two file need to be complied together. The program also takes in command line arguments. You need a -n to say how many cashiers you want, -s which is the earliest a new customer to come in -e which is the latest a new customer would come in and a -c for how many customers will come in between those two times. For example, if you wanted 3 cashiers and 1 new customer coming in every 5-10 minutes it would look like a.out -n 3 -s 5 -e 10 -c 1
